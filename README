METHODS
    *   address

        Optional. Gets or sets the e-mail address that the reports will be
        sent to. By default, this is set to cpan-testers@perl.org. You
        shouldn't need this unless the CPAN Tester's change the e-mail
        address to send report's to.

    *   comments

        Optional. Gets or sets the comments on the test report. This is most
        commonly used for distributions that did not pass a 'make test'.

    *   debug

        Optional. Gets or sets the value that will turn debugging on or off.
        Debug messages are sent to STDERR. 1 for on, 0 for off. Debugging
        generates very verbose output and is useful mainly for finding bugs
        in Test::Reporter itself.

    *   dir

        Optional. Defaults to the current working directory. This method
        specifies the directory that write() writes test report files to.

    *   distribution

        Gets or sets the name of the distribution you're working on, for
        example Foo-Bar-0.01. There are no restrictions on what can be put
        here.

    *   edit_comments

        Optional. Allows one to interactively edit the comments within a
        text editor. comments() doesn't have to be first specified, but it
        will work properly if it was. Accepts an optional hash of arguments:

        *   suffix

            Optional. Allows one to specify the suffix ("extension") of the
            temp file used by edit_comments. Defaults to '.txt'.

    *   errstr

        Returns an error message describing why something failed. You must
        check errstr() on a send() in order to be guaranteed delivery. This
        is optional if you don't intend to use Test::Reporter to send
        reports via e-mail, see 'send' below for more information.

    *   from

        Optional. Gets or sets the e-mail address of the individual
        submitting the test report, i.e. "afoxson@pobox.com (Adam Foxson)".
        This is mostly of use to testers running under Windows, since
        Test::Reporter will usually figure this out automatically.
        Alternatively, you can use the MAILADDRESS environmental variable to
        accomplish the same.

    *   grade

        Gets or sets the success or failure of the distributions's 'make
        test' result. This must be one of:

          grade     meaning
          -----     -------
          pass      all tests passed
          fail      one or more tests failed
          na        distribution will not work on this platform
          unknown   distribution did not include tests

    *   mail_send_args -- DEPRECATED

        Kept for backwards compatibility. Use "transport_args" instead.

        Optional. If you have MailTools installed and you want to have it
        behave in a non-default manner, parameters that you give this method
        will be passed directly to the constructor of Mail::Mailer. See
        Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send for details.

    *   message_id

        Returns an automatically generated Message ID. This Message ID will
        later be included as an outgoing mail header in the test report
        e-mail. This was included to conform to local mail policies at
        perl.org. This method courtesy of Email::MessageID.

    *   mx

        Optional. Gets or sets the mail exchangers that will be used to send
        the test reports. If you override the default values make sure you
        pass in a reference to an array. By default, this contains the MX's
        known at the time of release for perl.org. If you do not have
        Mail::Send installed (thus using the Net::SMTP interface) and do
        have Net::DNS installed it will dynamically retrieve the latest
        MX's. You really shouldn't need to use this unless the hardcoded
        MX's have become wrong and you don't have Net::DNS installed.

    *   new

        This constructor returns a Test::Reporter object. It will optionally
        accept named parameters for: mx, address, grade, distribution, from,
        comments, via, timeout, debug, dir, perl_version, and transport.

    *   perl_version

        Returns a hashref containing _archname, _osvers, and _myconfig based
        upon the perl that you are using. Alternatively, you may supply a
        different perl (path to the binary) as an argument, in which case
        the supplied perl will be used as the basis of the above data.

    *   report

        Returns the actual content of a report, i.e. "This distribution has
        been tested as part of the cpan-testers...". 'comments' must first
        be specified before calling this method, if you have comments to
        make and expect them to be included in the report.

    *   send

        Sends the test report to cpan-testers@perl.org and cc's the e-mail
        to the specified recipients, if any. If you do specify recipients to
        be cc'd and you do not have Mail::Send installed be sure that you
        use the author's @cpan.org address otherwise they will not be
        delivered. You must check errstr() on a send() in order to be
        guaranteed delivery. Technically, this is optional, as you may use
        Test::Reporter to only obtain the 'subject' and 'report' without
        sending an e-mail at all, although that would be unusual.

    *   subject

        Returns the subject line of a report, i.e. "PASS Mail-Freshmeat-1.20
        Darwin 6.0". 'grade' and 'distribution' must first be specified
        before calling this method.

    *   timeout

        Optional. Gets or sets the timeout value for the submission of test
        reports. Default is 120 seconds.

    *   transport

        Optional. Gets or sets the transport type. The transport type
        argument is refers to a 'Test::Reporter::Transport' subclass. The
        default is 'Net::SMTP', which uses the
        [Test::Reporter::Transport::Net::SMTP] class.

        You can add additional arguments after the transport selection.
        These will be passed to the constructor of the lower-level
        transport. This can be used to great effect for all manner of fun
        and enjoyment. ;-) See "transport_args".

        If Net::SMTP::TLS is used, 'Username' and 'Password' key-value
        transport arguments must be provided.

         $reporter->transport( 
             'Net::SMTP::TLS', Username => 'jdoe', Password => '123' 
         );

        If the 'HTTP' transport is used, two additional arguments are
        required: a URL to a Test::Reporter::HTTPGateway compatible server
        and an (optional) API key.

         $reporter->transport( 
             'HTTP', 'http://example.com/reporter-gateway/', '123456' 
         );

        This is not designed to be an extensible platform upon which to
        build transport plugins. That functionality is planned for the
        next-generation release of Test::Reporter, which will reside in the
        CPAN::Testers namespace.

    *   transport_args

        Optional. Gets or sets transport arguments that will used in the
        constructor for the selected transport, as appropriate.

    *   via

        Optional. Gets or sets the value that will be appended to
        X-Reported-Via, generally this is useful for distributions that use
        Test::Reporter to report test results. This would be something like
        "CPANPLUS 0.036".

    *   write and read

        These methods are used in situations where you test on a machine
        that has port 25 blocked and there is no local MTA. You use write()
        on the machine that you are testing from, transfer the written test
        reports from the testing machine to the sending machine, and use
        read() on the machine that you actually want to submit the reports
        from. write() will write a file in an internal format that contains
        'From', 'Subject', and the content of the report. The filename will
        be represented as:
        grade.distribution.archname.osvers.seconds_since_epoch.pid.rpt.
        write() uses the value of dir() if it was specified, else the cwd.

        On the machine you are testing from:

          my $reporter = Test::Reporter->new
          (
            grade => 'pass',
            distribution => 'Test-Reporter-1.16',
          )->write();

        On the machine you are submitting from:

          my $reporter;
          $reporter = Test::Reporter->new()->read('pass.Test-Reporter-1.16.i686-linux.2.2.16.1046685296.14961.rpt')->send() || die $reporter->errstr(); # wrap in an opendir if you've a lot to submit

        write() also accepts an optional filehandle argument:

          my $fh; open $fh, '>-';  # create a STDOUT filehandle object
          $reporter->write($fh);   # prints the report to STDOUT

CAVEATS
    If you specify recipients to be cc'd while using send() (and you do not
    have Mail::Send installed) be sure that you use the author's @cpan.org
    address otherwise they may not be delivered, since the perl.org MX's are
    unlikely to relay for anything other than perl.org and cpan.org.

    If you experience a long delay sending mail with Test::Reporter, you may
    be experiencing a wait as Test::Reporter attempts to determine your
    email domain. Setting the MAILDOMAIN environment variable will avoid
    this delay.

    *   Net::Domain

        This is optional. If it's installed Test::Reporter will try even

    *   Net::DNS

        This is optional. If it's installed Test::Reporter will dynamically
        retrieve the mail exchangers for perl.org, instead of relying on the
        MX's known at the time of this release.

    *   Mail::Send

        This is optional. If it's installed Test::Reporter will use
        Mail::Send instead of Net::SMTP.

    *   Test::Reporter::HTTPGateway

        This is optional. It provides a web API for the 'HTTP' transport
        method.
