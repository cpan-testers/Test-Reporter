        - It is now possible to override the automatic selection of a

        - We now explicitly specify the license (same terms as perl itself) in

        - update T:R->write() to accept a second argument, filehandle object
        - ucfirst'd globals that were lowercase

1.20    Wed Mar 05 04:03:07 2003
        - fixed a minor bug with read()

1.19    Wed Mar 05 03:03:07 2003
        - added dir() -- specifies default directory to write report files to
        - added write() -- writes a test report to disk
        - added read() -- reads a test report from disk
        - These three methods are used in situations where you test on a
          machine that has port 25 blocked and there is no local MTA. You use
          write() on the machine that you are testing from, and use read() on
          the machine that you want to actually submit the reports from

1.16    Tue Feb 25 04:00:00 2003
        - abstract now matches PAUSE meta-data for this distribution
        - better POD documentation
        - header pass-through for X-Reported-Via, via via() -- this is useful
          for third-party distributions, like CPANPLUS, that use Test::Reporter
        - added 'debug' get/set method -- this is extremely verbose and
          primarily of use for debugging Test::Reporter itself
        - added 'address' get/set method -- specifies the e-mail address that
          the reports should be sent to -- you shouldn't need this unless the
          CPAN Tester's change the e-mail address to send report's to
        - added 'from' get/set method -- specifies the e-mail address of the
          individual doing the reporting -- you generally shouldn't need this
          as Test::Reporter tries very hard to guess your e-mail address
          automatically
        - added 'mx' get/set method -- specifies the MX's for perl.org -- you
          really shouldn't need to use this unless the hardcoded MX's have
          become wrong and you don't have Net::DNS installed
        - the constructor now takes named parameters
        - we now use Net::DNS to get MX's if Net::DNS is available
        - we now use Net::Domain to better auto-guess the reporter's email
          address
        - we now use Mail::Send to send reports, if it's available
        - now cycles through all available MX servers, when using Net::SMTP
        - added bin/cpantest
        - T::R now allows testers to edit the report interactively via the
          edit_comments() method
        - T::R report's have been made less susceptible to being marked as spam
        - "can't call method "mail" on an undefined value" bug fixed
        - doubled the number of tests
        - memoized certain methods
        - bundling Date::Format and Time::Zone to assist in SMTP sends (for
          'Date')
        - bundling an updated Mail::Util

1.13    Sun Aug 12 03:20:08 2002
